    <h3>Academic Work</h3>
    <p>
      Many of my projects come from coursework focused on web design and digital
      media. These assignments emphasize semantic HTML, accessibility, and
      thoughtful content organization. Rather than visual complexity, my work
      prioritizes clarity, structure, and ease of navigation for users.

    <h3>Creative Exploration</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to academic projects, I enjoy experimenting with creative ideas
      such as layout planning, information hierarchy, and storytelling through
      content. These projects help me better understand how users move through
      digital spaces and how design decisions affect comprehension and engagement.
