  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I am a student with an interest in web design, interaction design, and digital
      storytelling. I enjoy learning how structure and accessibility influence how
      people experience websites. Rather than focusing only on how things look,
      I value designing systems that are intuitive, meaningful, and usable by
      a wide range of audiences.

    <h3>Interests and Goals</h3>
    <p>
      My goals include continuing to improve my technical skills in HTML and CSS
      while gaining a deeper understanding of accessibility and user-centered
      design. I am especially interested in projects that blend creativity with
      problem solving and empathy. Long term, I hope to work on digital products
      that have a positive impact on users.
