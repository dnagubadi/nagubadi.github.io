    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I am a 3rd year student with an interest in web design, human computer interaction, and digital
      media. I enjoy learning how to structure and design website for accessibility. Outside of school, I 
      enjoy playing & teaching guitar, skiing, climbing, video games and watching movies.

    <h3>Interests and Goals</h3>
    <p>
      My goals include continuing to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      and Figma, while trying to focus on accessibility and user-centered
      design. I'm going to start building my personal website including my portfolio,
      resume and guitar materials for my students. Long term, I hope to work in ui/ux design or digital product
      design.
