    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This site is designed to showcase
      my interests, projects, and goals as a student exploring web design and
      digital media. The structure of this portfolio focuses on clarity, meaning,
      and accessibility rather than visual styling. Each page is built using
      semantic HTML to ensure that the content is understandable for both users
      and assistive technologies.

    <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this portfolio, you will find information about my background,
      the types of projects I enjoy working on, and ways to get in touch with me.
      My goal is to create digital experiences that are thoughtful, easy to
      navigate, and inclusive. This site serves as both a learning exercise and
      a foundation for future professional work.
