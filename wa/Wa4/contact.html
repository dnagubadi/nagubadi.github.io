    <h3>Get in Touch</h3>
    <p>
      This page provides information on how to reach me for questions, collaboration,
      or general inquiries. I am always interested in discussing design ideas,
      academic projects, or opportunities to learn more about web development and
      digital media. Clear communication is important to me, and I value thoughtful
      conversations.

    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a student and most available through academic or professional
      channels. While this site does not include a contact form, it serves as a
      starting point for connection and future updates. I plan to expand this
      section as my portfolio continues to grow.
